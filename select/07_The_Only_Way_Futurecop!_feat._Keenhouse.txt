It's a fine line to walk on when you're down by the beach
It's a fine line
It's a fine line to walk on when you're down by yourself
It's a fine line
And time complicates things most of the time
Where do you go from here?
And when it's all blown up in smoke
A patch of solitude up in the sky

Because you know know know up is the only way
The only way, the only way out
Because you know know know up is the only way
The only way, the only way out
Because you know know know up is the only way
The only way, the only way out
Because you know know know up is the only way
The only way, the only way out

It's a fine line to walk on when you're out on your own
It's a fine line
It's such a fine line to walk on when you're down by yourself
It's a fine line
And time complicates things most of the time
Where do you go from here?
And when it's all blown up in smoke
A patch of solitude up in the sky

Because you know know know up is the only way
The only way, the only way out
Because you know know know up is the only way
The only way, the only way out
Because you know know know up is the only way
The only way, the only way out
Because you know know know up is the only way
The only way, the only way out

Because you know know know up is the only way
The only way, the only way out
Because you know know know up is the only way
The only way, the only way out
