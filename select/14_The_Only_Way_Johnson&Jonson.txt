(After crying all night long)
Cause this song reminded me of my peeps
I pour some liquor for my nigga, rest in peace
(Laughin and talkin) For hours about the current state of all this
Bullshit flooding the market yet they call themselves artists?
(Like there ain't nothing wrong) Please. Heartless muthafuckin partners
Creating schemes to make our dreams seem smaller and smaller
(Cause if I ever) Have a chance to make a change, I will
And I ain't laying down my soul for gold or any forms of bills, forget it
(...)
(The lonely/only way) To make it out this motherfuckin ghetto
Without hustling drugs or busting metal
(I can get through the day) Is by praying before my mission starts
Giving heart and soul to every piece of scroll I've written off
(Is to make our life) A little worth living on earth
God has given us a choice and I've chosen to make it work
(Like it was yesterday) Like when we used to use our brains
Now we're losing our minds, grinding for change instead of changing it
(I get up in the morning) And go to work without change
And spit a verse about changing the game
(After crying all night long) From the state it's in
Yeah, about that same old song
Wondering, will these niggas stop making that same old song?
