What could I have done to make you hit me so hard
Your cigarette's not the only thing that's left a scar
You make me feel like painting the bathroom red
I better leave before I'm brain dead

It's the only way out
It's the only way out of here
It's the only way out
It's the only way out of here
Well it's the only way
Well it's the only way out

Mama says you're not supposed to touch me there
Be a good little girl and give daddy your teddy bear
Now she's on the corner selling lemonade
Papa selling pictures of her in a cage

It's the only way out
It's the only way out of here
It's the only way out
It's the only way out of here
Well it's the only way
Well it's the only way out

There are some things you can never ignore
There's so much sick folk in this world we adore
